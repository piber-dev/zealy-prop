# Zealy Proposal Q2

## Introduction

The program previously targeting marketing and education is back after two successful runs! This time, we are aiming to introduce a way to make it run year-round without breaks, improve the education, and to incentivize direct contributions to Akash.

## Important notes from the last proposal

The planned user's journey was received with negative feedback from users as these missions led to a lower user retention than normal and to long waiting times before they could finish the next sprint. These missions also took up a lot of reviewing time and was automated by botters using AI generated text. 

The "Star GitHub Repo's" mission was scrapped as although there was real users completing the mission showing screenshots of doing so, we believe automated anti-spam systems on GitHub prevented us to see the stars both from the user's profile and on the repo's themselves.

The "Deploy on Akash Console" mission was automated and botted but also very successful among real users, having 300 total successful submissions in total across the 3 months.

The "Create a web-app & deploy it on Akash" mission did receive a few submissions, for a total of 56 submissions at the end of the campaign.

Approximately 20% of submissions during the January sprint was suspected by us to be automatically completed and submitted by a highly skilled botter.

The first promotional mission "Deploy on Quasarch" was successful, bringing the beta testing feedback of 140 users and at least the same number of users to the platform at a cost of 1.0-2.5 AKT per user.

## Changes to the program

As we figured out a workflow on how to limit the downtime between sprints, we are going to put this into practice and make the Zealy program be available almost every day of the year instead of having days or weeks of downtime sometimes like we used to have.

Abuse is something that we have always seen to an extent on Zealy, but now with the large scale it has been happening on we are going to create missions in such a way that it cannot be exploited anymore. One example of this is the "Develop your own ideas!" mission we had in the February sprint where people could submit projects to a few different tracks with only the best project being eligible for a larger prize.

## Resources required

In the past, we have only used 2 roles in total in the Zealy Program, but now we are considering changing this so that it can scale. It still uses less funds in total when compared to previously approved proposal in [discussion 633](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/633), but gives us the opportunity to let other people contribute and for us to be more flexible with who is responsible for what tasks.

> 1x community manager @ $750/role/month (taking the lead on wg-zealy calls; writing announcements; reaching out to people in DMs; paying out rewards; etc)
> 1x technical administrator @ $750/role/month (giving technical updates on wg-zealy calls, compiling data, fighting abuse)
> 2x mission leads @ $500/role/month (creating new community, technical, and promotional missions)
> 2x mission reviewers @ $500/role/month (reviewing all missions within 1-2 weeks)

## Proposal funding

Due to the steering committee meeting not always occuring at the last Thursday of each month, we are going back to requesting 4 months at a time with a month-long buffer at the end where we present our results and request additional funds. This will be done exactly as we did previously:

> We are also proposing asking for funding for at least 4 months at a time while reporting every 3 months to ensure that we can make the program run without breaks. One period can be between months 1-3 and then this will be reported on, and any changes/discussion will be made during the 4th month. The 4th month would be included in the next report and months 5 and 6 would include potential changes from the discussion on month 4. With our current system we have been unable to run the program without breaks because we plan the new periods during the breaks. - [discussion 633](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/633)

If no changes are made, we will request funding for 4 months for a total balance of $28000 USD making the total request to be approximately $20000 USD after keeping the rewards pool donation in mind.
