# Zealy Proposal Q2

## Introduction

The program targeting marketing and education is back! This time, we are fighting abuse, scaling the program away from Zealy, and improving downtime's between the sprints. Support us to see monthly sprints and a few smaller contests being hosted the coming months.

## Highlights from the last proposal

The planned user's journey was received with negative feedback from users as these missions led to a lower user retention than normal and to long waiting times before they could finish the next sprint. These missions also took up a lot of reviewing time and was automated by botters using AI generated text. 

The "Star GitHub Repo's" mission was scrapped as although there was real users completing the mission showing screenshots of doing so, we believe automated anti-spam systems on GitHub prevented us to see the stars both from the user's profile and on the repo's themselves.

The "Deploy on Akash Console" mission was automated and botted but also very successful among real users, having 300 total successful submissions in total across the 3 months.

The "Create a web-app & deploy it on Akash" mission did receive a good number of submissions, for a total of 56 submissions at the end of the campaign.

Approximately 20% of submissions during the January sprint was suspected by us to be automatically completed and submitted by a highly skilled botter.

The first promotional mission "Deploy on Quasarch" was successful, bringing the beta testing feedback of 140 users and at least the same number of users to the platform at a cost of 1.0-2.5 AKT per user.

Although it wasn't easy, we were able to keep the budget in check.

## Changes to the program

As we figured out a workflow on how to limit the downtime between sprints, we are going to put this into practice and make the Zealy program be available almost every day of the year instead of having days or weeks of downtime sometimes like we used to have.

Abuse is something that we have always seen to an extent on Zealy, but now with the large scale it has been happening on we are going to create missions in such a way that it cannot be exploited anymore. One example of this is the "Develop your own ideas!" mission we had in the February sprint where people could submit projects to a few different tracks with only the best project being eligible for a larger prize.

Another idea we want to bring forward is making the program less reliant on Zealy, giving us the opportunity to host smaller contests on other platforms as well such as Galxe and hosting our own competitions not relying on any paid platform at all. This will be worked on with the same rewards budget and only given to successful participants like always, just that we may diverge a little from Zealy to explore other ways of finding and educating users.

## Resources required

In the past, we have only used 2 roles in total in the Zealy Program, but now we are considering changing this so that it can scale. Last run, we wanted to make the program smaller but got overwhelmed with abuse and complaints, so now we are bringing it back to the level previously used in [discussion 633](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/633). By changing the number of roles and using the same budget as previously approved, this gives us the opportunity to let other people contribute and for us to be more flexible with who is responsible for what tasks.

> 1x community manager @ $750/role/month (taking the lead on wg-zealy calls; writing announcements; reaching out to people in DMs; paying out rewards; etc)
> 
> 1x technical administrator @ $750/role/month (giving technical updates on wg-zealy calls, compiling data, creating/updating scripts, fighting abuse)
> 
> 1x mission/contest lead @ $1000/role/month (creating new community, technical, and promotional missions and arranging specialized contests such as gamejams and focused and small hackathons)
> 
> 2x mission reviewers @ $750/role/month (reviewing all missions within 1-2 weeks and judging all contests)
> 
> Total: $4000/month

## Proposal funding

Due to the steering committee meeting not always occuring at the last Thursday of each month, we are going back to requesting 4 months at a time with a month-long buffer at the end where we present our results and request additional funds. This will be done exactly as we did previously:

> We are also proposing asking for funding for at least 4 months at a time while reporting every 3 months to ensure that we can make the program run without breaks. One period can be between months 1-3 and then this will be reported on, and any changes/discussion will be made during the 4th month. The 4th month would be included in the next report and months 5 and 6 would include potential changes from the discussion on month 4. With our current system we have been unable to run the program without breaks because we plan the new periods during the breaks. - [discussion 633](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/633)

We are going to start a sprint for March under the assumption that the proposal is going to pass, but if it does not we will quickly end it and pay out rewards from the small amount of left-over funds.

If no changes are made, we will request funding for 4 months for a total balance of $28000 USD making the total request to be approximately $20000 USD after keeping the rewards pool donation in mind.
